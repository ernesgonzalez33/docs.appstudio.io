= Java build service

== JVM build service
The JVM build service enhances your Java builds by providing the following features:

* A local cache of Maven artifacts to speed up build times

* A software bill of materials (SBOM) based on artifact tracking to find dependencies in your final image

* The ability to rebuild Java dependencies from the source so that you can be sure of your dependencies' provenance

You can configure standard Java builds in either of the following situations:

* When you have xref:cli/proc_enabled_java_dependencies.adoc[enabled dependencies rebuild]

* When you have xref:cli/proc_disabled_java_dependencies.adoc[disabled dependencies rebuild]

== Additional resources

For information about the components that you use when configuring standard Java builds with enabled dependencies, see xref:concepts/java-build-service/java-build-service-components.adoc[Java build service components].
