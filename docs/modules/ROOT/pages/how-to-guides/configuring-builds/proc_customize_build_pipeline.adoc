= Customizing the build pipeline

To meet your specific needs, customize the way that {ProductName} builds components. You can customize it in two ways:

* Change the parameters of the build pipeline of a component.
* Extend the pipeline with your own tasks (or deleting existing tasks).

For example, you can change for how long {ProductName} saves the container images of component, by changing the value of the `image-expires-after` parameter. Or you can ensure that the container images it builds for a component are compliant with regulations for your industry, by adding a compliance check as a task to its build pipeline. 

.Prerequisites
To customize a build pipeline, you must first xref:how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline.adoc[upgrade it]. 

.Procedure

To customize the build pipeline in any way, start by completing the following steps:

. In your preferred IDE, navigate to the `.tekton` directory in the repository of your component.

. Open both `.yaml` files in the repository.
 

== Changing parameters

.Procedure

. In each `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, customize the parameters of the build pipeline by changing the pipeline `params`:
.. Pipeline params have the paths `.spec.params` and `.pipelineSpec.params`
.. Change the default `value` of existing parameters. For example, you can set the value of `image-expires-after` to `2w`, instead of `5d` 
.. Add parameters. New parameters must include a `name` and `value`.
. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.


== Extending the build pipeline with your own tasks

.Procedure

. In each `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, add a new task under `tasks`.

Example task:
+
[source]
--
name: example-task
      params:
      - name: example-param
        value: “Example”
      runAfter:
      - build-container #You can be more specific by choosing another task
      taskRef:
        bundle: <path to container image> 
        name: example-task
      when:
      - input: $(params.skip-checks)    #This references the pipeline parameters
        operator: in
        values:
        - "false"
--
+
NOTE: If you want to define a task directly in this file, rather than using `taskRef`, you can use `taskSpec`. Visit the documentation linked in the <<additional-resources>> section.

+
. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.


== Verification

When you commit changes to these `.yaml` files in your repository, {ProductName} automatically triggers a new build. Wait for {ProductName} to complete the new build, then verify your changes have been made by following these steps:

. Navigate to *Activity > Pipeline runs*.
. Select the most recent build pipeline run. 
. In the *Details* tab, confirm that there are new tasks that you added in the pipeline visualization.
. In the *Logs* tab, confirm the following:
.. Any new tasks are in the navigation bar. 
.. If you changed a parameter's value, and that value gets printed, the new value is in the log.

== Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues with your customized pipeline, try the following solutions:

* If you believe that your desired parameter values are not being passed into the pipeline, make sure that your assignment of that value doesn't get overwritten later in the `.yaml` file.

* If your new task is not appearing in the pipeline run, ensure the following:
** You added it to the correct place in the `.yaml` files, so that it has the path `.spec.params` or `.pipelineSpec.params`. 
** You specified a valid `runAfter` field, and that the task in that field completed successfully.

* For problems with both parameters and tasks, make sure you committed your changes to the `.tekton` directory in the repository that {ProductName} references for the component.

* If your build pipeline can no longer successfully run, your best option is to simply rebuild the `.tekton` directory:
** Delete the `.tekton` directory in the repository of the component.
** In the {ProductName} console, on the *Overview* tab for the relevant application, scroll down and select *Manage build pipelines*.
** Select the three dots next to the relevant component and select *Roll back to default pipeline*.
** Complete the steps for xref:how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline.adoc[upgrading the build pipeline] of that component again.
